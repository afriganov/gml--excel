Script takes .gml files provided by OSS(ZIS-private) and extracts information about parcels and their owners and organizes them in a meaningful table thats ready to use in many cadastral tasks

Output is divided into two excel files, masterpos for cadastre and masterzk for land registry. Last part of the code alignes data so they fit correctly when merged, but in many cases, because data itself is faulty, everything goes south and some manipulation has to be done by hand.
